# Code Review

Code review written by [Tobias Åhlund](https://github.com/tobias-ahlund).

1. `index.php:11` - You might wanna use a unit of measurement for width and height.
2. `links.php:11` - You should use a semicolon right after the brackets when calling the function. 
3. `functions.php:9` - An echo statement should end with a semicolon.
4. `functions.php:10` - Consider separating HTML from PHP.
5. `styles.css:2` - The line of code should be “box-sizing: border-box;”.
6. `styles.css:21` - Line-height needs to be “1.5”. “1,5” won’t work.
